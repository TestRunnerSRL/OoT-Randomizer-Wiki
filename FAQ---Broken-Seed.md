# "My Seed Is Broken!" (Glitchless Logic)
Solutions to completing randomized runs of _Ocarina of Time_ can sometimes be unintuitive. While your seed may appear to be unbeatable, this isn't often the case. Thanks to developers much smarter than myself, OoTR's logic is surprisingly robust. Listed below are some common sources of confusion, grouped by location. If you don't mind spoiling the rest of your playthrough, instructions to finding your next step will be listed [here](#knowing-the-way-with-the-spoiler-log).

If you follow these steps and still need help, you're welcome to ask for support in the bug-tracker channel of our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/3VJPQNK). Make sure to provide your seed and setting string along with any important details about the issue. If it turns out you have indeed encountered a logical flaw, kind members of our team will report issues from there.

## Problem Areas by Location

### Link's House:
#### Stuck beside bed
* Tilt the Control Stick to make Link move. Move him out the door and you will reach Kokiri Forest. The game gets much easier from there.

### Kakariko Village:
#### Well won't drain
* Project 64 is known to have issues with this, among other things. For the purposes of this project, we can only recommend using a different emulator.
#### Shooting Gallery gives 50 rupees
* The Fairy Bow/Quiver is required to win the special prize. Otherwise you will receive 50 rupees.

### Goron City:
#### Reach Goron City from Lost Woods without Bombs
* You can ignite the Bomb Flowers behind the boulders using Din's Fire.
#### Get big rolling Goron to relinquish goods
* Even if you have serious Zelda skills (or Bombchus), a Bomb Bag is required. Bomb the Goron in the tunnel near the sign.

### Lost Woods:
#### Skull Kid won't buy this sweet Skull Mask
* Skull Kid won't buy Skull Mask until you befriend him with Saria's Song.

### Zora's Domain:
#### Need Blue Fire to unfreeze King Zora/Zora shop
* If you have access to Ganon's Castle, Blue Fire can be found in Water Trial.  
* Blue Fire may be a purchasable item.
* As usual, Blue Fire can be obtained in Ice Cavern.

### Lake Hylia:
#### Go fishing
* You must have a sword in order to play the fishing minigame. It's because you need to threaten him or something.  
// FIXME: Is this still true? Do you need Kokiri Sword specifically?

### Temple of Time:
#### Open Door of Time
* Playing the Song of Time is the only requirement to opening the Door of Time.

### Forest Temple:
#### Get outside without Song of Time or Bow
* With Hover Boots you can float to the door connecting the large block-pushing room with the courtyard.

### Shadow Temple:
#### Spike floor room without Longshot
* Backflip onto the chest spawned in the middle of the room. From there you can use the Hookshot to reach the upper ledge.

### Spirit Temple:
#### Lower metal bridge on child side without Boomerang
* You can hit the crystal switch with a well-timed Bombchu placement in the opposite direction. Hopefully you'll hit it, or you'll have to go out and buy more Bombchus.

### Gerudo Training Grounds:
#### Lava room without Longshot
* You can reach the torch at the end of this room using only the Hookshot.
#### Timed boulder room without Longshot
* The target on the ceiling is just within range of the Hookshot if you stand directly under it.
* A wallmaster can also lift you up into the rupee if it's the last one you need to collect.

### Ganon's Castle
#### Spirit Trial without Din's Fire
* A precise shot of an arrow through the torch will burn the web to reveal the sunlight. Or moonlight. Maybe it's a big lamp, idk.

## Knowing the Way with the Spoiler Log
The spoiler log can be very helpful when looking for important items you missed. It takes only a few steps:
1. Open the spoiler log generated alongside your ROM. It should be formatted as `OoT_SETTINGSTR_SEED_Spoiler.txt`.
2. Scroll down to the section labeled _Way of the Hero_.
3. Ensure that you have collected all the items listed in the section, as they are essential to beating the game.
