## "My Seed Is Broken!"
Solutions to completing randomized runs of _Ocarina of Time_ can sometimes be unintuitive. While your seed may appear to be unbeatable, this isn't often the case. Thanks to developers much smarter than myself, OoTR's logic is surprisingly robust. Listed below are some common sources of confusion, grouped by location. If you don't mind spoiling the rest of your playthrough, instructions to finding your next step will be listed [here](#knowing-the-way-with-the-spoiler-log).

If you follow these steps and still need help, you're welcome to ask for support in the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/3VJPQNK). Make sure to provide your seed and setting string along with any important details about the issue. If it turns out you have indeed encountered a logical flaw, kind members of our team will report issues from there.

### Link's House:
#### Stuck beside Bed
> Tilt the Control Stick to make Link move. Move him out the door and you will reach Kokiri Forest.

### Shadow Temple:
#### Spike Floor Room without Longshot
> Backflip onto the chest spawned in the middle of the room. From there you can use the Hookshot to reach the upper ledge.

### Gerudo Training Grounds:
#### Lava Room without Longshot
> You can reach the torch at the end of this room using only the Hookshot.

### Knowing the Way with the Spoiler Log
The spoiler log can be very helpful when looking for important items you missed. It takes only a few steps:
1. Open the spoiler log generated alongside your ROM. It should be formatted as `OoT_SETTINGSTR_SEED_Spoiler.txt`.
2. Scroll down to the section labeled _Way of the Hero_.
3. Ensure that you have collected all the items listed in the section, as they are essential to beating the game.
